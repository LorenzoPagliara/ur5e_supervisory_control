# acg_resources_panda_moveit_config

This package contains the Panda robot configuration used by the Automatic Control Group. It has been created through the MoveIt! Setup Assistant and then manually modified. Since the `.setup_assistant` file does not get modified upon manual modifications, additional functions shall be configured by manually editing the available launch and config files.
The `.setup_assistant` file is retained to allow the `MoveItConfigBuilder` to work properly, e.g. to load a custom SRDF file instead of the default `<config_dir_path>/<robot_name>.srdf` file.

Some of the modifications applied to this package are listed here below. The list is not exhaustive and it cannot be, as this package is likely to evolve with time and there is no reason to keep track of all the modifications with respect to the Setup Assistant's baseline in this Readme:

* `initial_velocities.yaml` and `initial_efforts.yaml` have been added to contain initial velocities and efforts for the `ros2_control` plugin. At the moment, `initial_velocities.yaml` is read by `panda.ros2_control.xacro`, while `initial_efforts.yaml` is only a placeholder in case it is going to be needed in the future.
* Default planners configurations that are not provided with this package are read from the official `moveit_configs_utils` package by the `move_group.launch.py` (also called by `demo.launch.py`). In this package `ompl_planning.yaml` has been manually configured starting from the default one in order for the user to be able to enforce planning in the joint space (if they wish to) when Cartesian constraints are set. This configuration now overrides the default one.
* The launch file `moveit_rviz.launch.py` has been modified to allow the user specifying relative paths when loading RViz configurations (in place of absolute ones).
* Two configurations are provided for RViz, namely `moveit.rviz` (default) and `planning_demo.rviz`. The former loads the MotionPlanning plugin, while the latter loads several plugins for external applications to send results to RViz, like planned joint space and end-effector trajectories, obstacles and replay of executions.

## Usage with Motion Planning plugin

In order to execute a demo with RViz's **MotionPlanning** plugin, run

```bash
ros2 launch acg_resources_panda_moveit_config demo.launch.py
```

## Usage with external planning application

The only difference with the previous modality is the RViz's configuration, which loads **MarkerArray**, **PlanningScene** and **Trajectory** plugins for external applications to effectively visualize the results of planning and execution:

```bash
ros2 launch acg_resources_panda_moveit_config demo.launch.py rviz_config:=planning_demo.rviz
```

## Trajectory execution

Together with planning, this package supports trajectory execution through `ros2_control`. Several configurations are available, described here below.

### Execution with mock hardware and MoveIt! reference generator

The `demo.launch.py` demo provides a basic execution demo using mock hardware, loading a `ros2_control_node` (identified by `ros2 node list` as `/controller_manager`) and spawning a joint trajectory controller. In this case, a `moveit_simple_controller_manager` is also instantiated, which, despite its name, provides action clients connecting to the controllers loaded by the (real) controller manager. For more information, please refer to [this tutorial](https://moveit.picknik.ai/humble/doc/examples/controller_configuration/controller_configuration_tutorial.html).

### Execution with mock hardware and external reference generator

If the user intends to provide reference generators outside of MoveIt!, they can rely on the following demo:

```bash
ros2 launch acg_resources_panda_moveit_config ros2_control_demo.launch.py
```

The demo loads a forward position controller, therefore position references can be sent by an external reference generator, such as `ros2 topic pub`, e.g.

```bash
ros2 topic pub /panda_forward_position_controller/commands std_msgs/msg/Float64MultiArray "data: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.7, 0.0, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0]"
```

When using mock hardware, remember that commands are just copied in the state, but no simulation really happens. Therefore, if switching to a velocity controller, the user shall not expect the mock robot to move. However, its state, as read by `/joint_states`, shall update according to the commands.

### Execution with Gazebo

This demo is the same as the demo above, but `gz_ros2_control::GazeboSimROS2ControlPlugin` plugin is used instead of launching a dedicated `ros2_control_node`. This means that the control node (and, therefore, the controller manager) is started by Gazebo at the time the plugin is loaded. Also, in terms of hardware, the `gz_ros2_control/GazeboSimSystem` is used instead of mock hardware.

To launch the demo, run

```bash
ros2 launch acg_resources_panda_moveit_config gazebo_ros2_control_demo.launch.py
```

This demo launches the forward position controller by default, but it can be changed at launch time by properly setting the `controller` parameter.

Position references can be sent to the Gazebo robot by an external reference generator, such as `ros2 topic pub`, e.g.

```bash
ros2 topic pub /panda_forward_position_controller/commands std_msgs/msg/Float64MultiArray "data: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.7, 0.0, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0]"
```

Some remarks:

* The robot falls under the effect of gravity and stops falling when the motion controller is loaded; differently from old versions of Gazebo, the controllers are only loaded if the simulator is not paused; this prevents loading the controllers before the action of gravity.
* If switching to a velocity controller, remember that the `data` field in the `Float64MultiArray` shall be a vector of 7 elements (instead of 8): the gripper fingers cannot be velocity-commanded.
* When moving the robot in Gazebo, remember that only one of the fingers is controlled, while the other should mirror; however, at the time of writing, no mimicking plugin has been configured.

### Execution with Gazebo and MoveIt! planning system

This package also offers a complete planning and simulation setup with the following demo:

```bash
ros2 launch acg_resources_panda_moveit_config moveit_gazebo_ros2_control_demo.launch.py
```

Here, the user can plan trajectories through the MoveIt! planning pipeline by using the `MotionPlanning` plugin in RViz. Execution is performed on the Gazebo robot through the `moveit_simple_controller_manager`, which uses the loaded joint trajectory controller.

Some remarks:

* In this demo, the fall is recovered by spawning a reference generator at launch time, which sends references to a temporarily loaded forward position controller, then, when the robot is up, such controller is replaced with a joint trajectory controller.
* Recovering from the fall is a necessary step for the simulator to work as expected when receiving trajectory references: sometimes, after falling, joint 4 seems "locked" and this prevents trajectories to be correctly executed; this looks like a bug, even though, at the time of writing, we could not find any confirmation of this online.

## Robot prefix

All the launch files used in this package accept a `tf_prefix` parameter. Use it to replace the default `panda/` prefix with something different for your application. Such a prefix must be consistent with joint names used in configuration files.

## Known issues

The following startup errors and warnings are expected because they concern parts of the system that are not configured:
